### About Mitron Bank 
Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market.

### Objective of the Project 
This project serves as a pilot for Mitron Bank’s credit card expansion. It analyzes the provided sample data and delivers actionable insights to the strategy team, helping them tailor credit card offerings to customer needs and market trends to increase market share.

### Problem Statment   

 * **Demographic classification:** Segment customers based on demographic attributes such as age group, gender, occupation, and city to uncover meaningful patterns in their financial behavior.
   
 * **Avg income utilisation %:** Calculate the average income utilization percentage (avg_spends / avg_income), a key metric indicating the likelihood of credit card usage—higher utilization suggests a greater propensity to adopt and use credit cards.
   
 * **Spending Insights:** Analyze where customers spend the most and examine how spending varies across demographics (occupation, gender, city, age). These insights can inform targeted offers, such as specialized rewards for specific purchase categories or demographic groups.

 * **Key Customer Segments:** Identify and profile high-value customer segments most likely to adopt the new credit cards by exploring their demographic characteristics, spending habits, and financial preferences.

 * **Credit Card Feature Recommendations:** Recommend key credit card features that would increase customer adoption and usage, based on observed behaviors and segment-specific needs.
